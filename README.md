# Kalman Filter Algorithm  

## Project Overview
This project is designed for the purpose of learning the mathematics, coding and implementation of Kalman filter algorithm.

Kalman filter is a commonly used state estimation algorithm for data from electronic sensors. 

It predicts the sensor value based on the past, current readings and gives a wieght(trust factor) between the measurement and prediction.

This project is divided into two phases:
- Phase 1: Translation lecture examples into functional code
- Phase 2: Familiarization with the use of FilterPy library

## Deliverables

## Project Timeline
Phase 1Ô∏è‚É£:  week 2 of October 2023 to week 3 of November 2023   
Phase 2Ô∏è‚É£:  week 3 of November 2023 to Present
